	<h1 style="font-size:30px">What is the One Punch Man workout?</h1>
	<h3 style="color:black">As mentioned, the One Punch Man workout comes from the manga and subsequent anime series of the same name.
The series revolves around the fictional superhero Saitama, known as the One-Punch Man. Saitama is incredibly strong and can defeat any opponent with a single punch. In fact, Saitama plays a pivotal role in the seriesâ€™ ongoing conflict between monsters and superheroes.
Saitama claims to have developed his strength by following the One Punch Man workout, which consists of 100 situps, 100 pushups, 100 squats, and a 6.2-mile (10-km) run.
After following the workout for 3 years, Saitama loses his hair but develops his one-punch knockout power, which ultimately allows him to defeat the monsters.
Thus was born the One Punch Man workout.</h3>
